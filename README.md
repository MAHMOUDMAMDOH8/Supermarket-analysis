# Supermarket-analysis
The Supermarket-analysis project focuses on analyzing sales data from a supermarket. 

It involves creating a dimensional model using SQL to design and implement the data warehouse.

The project also includes populating the dimensional model with data and utilizing Power BI to create visualizations for analysis and reporting.

Key Components

Dimensional Model Design: Use SQL to design and create the dimensional model for the data warehouse. Define dimension and fact tables based on the supermarket sales data structure.

Data Population: Insert data into the dimension and fact tables of the data warehouse. Ensure the data is accurately mapped to the corresponding dimensions and facts.

Power BI Visualizations: Utilize Power BI Desktop to create interactive and visually appealing reports and dashboards. Design visualizations to analyze and explore the supermarket sales data, providing insights for decision-making and business intelligence.
